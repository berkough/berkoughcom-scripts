# Scripts for Berkough.com

Sometime ago I decided to [relaunch](https://berkouh.com/version4) my blog using [Write Freely](https://writefreely.org/), but I didn't want to have to worry about hosting my own instance, so I just went with [Write.as](https://write.as) which is the author's own hosting solution. This is a win-win for me. I get to suppor the developer working on a software product I like, and I don't have to worry about all the backend stuff. 

All the scripts in this repo are going to be things I've played around with on my Write.as blogs. Even though it's *berkoughcom-scripts* for [berkough.com](https://berkough.com), I'll be including stuff I do for [mtkultra.com](https://mtkultra.com) as well. I'm thinking of these as Write.as "plugins." Though, I suppose we'll see what the rest fo the community has to say about my thoughts.

Also, since it is just vanilla JS, these aren't in any kind of a format;

- style.css is going to be any specific styling that might need to be added to the custom CSS of your Write.as blog for the javascript functions to work properly.
- test.html will be a barebones boilerplate to test basic functionality.
- the named JS filed will be the "plugin" itself.

Each individual directory will have it's own Readme.
